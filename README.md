here i add the answer of the question that ph team required 

1. Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName and querySelector?

getElementById selects only one element by id.
getElementsByClassName selects multiple elements by class name.
querySelector selects first matching element.
querySelectorAll selects all matching elements.
